### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hobby software developer with particular interest in the JVM and its languages (Java, Kotlin, Clojure). I also feel comfortable with Python and have basic knowledge of Rust and frontend web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

In my spare time, I prefer writing libraries and tools for other programmers over applications with user interfaces. This reflects upon the majority of my open source projects.

## Projects

Here is a (selected) list of projects I'm currently working on or have worked on in the past - paid commissions are not included here. I am the only contributor in most cases, so help is always appreciated!

### Spigot projects

Projects related to the Minecraft server software [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org). I just have so many of these they get an own category.

- [compatre](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/compatre): A runtime tool for Spigot programmers to drastically reduce the work required to write version independent code
  - state: alpha
  - big feature additions planned
- [spigot-maps](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/spigot-maps): A library to put custom images and text on Minecraft map items
  - state: stable, version 2.1
  - some frequently requested features still to be added
- [spiglin](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/spiglin): A collection of facilities for people programming Spigot plugins using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) programming language
  - state: stable
  - upcoming version 2.1
- [WeLoveOpenSourcePlugins](https://github.wlosp.org): An organisation dedicated to open source Spigot plugins
  - state: open to the public
  - still needs more infrastructure (official website, logo, SpigotMC account, etc.)
  - **contributors welcome**: read the [contribution guidelines and information](https://github.wlosp.org/contribute) and [request an invite](https://join.wlosp.org)
- [presents](https://github.wlosp.org/presents): A Spigot plugin that lets you create and hide presents in your Minecraft world
  - state: released
  
### Other

None-Spigot projects. 

- [javidaloca](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/javidaloca): Java bindings for the Rust implementation of [project fluent](https://projectfluent.org), a spec for i18n
  - state: functioning, but unreleased
  - Java/Rust integration still needs to be figured out (cross-compiling and such)
  - only basic coverage of the features so far
  - need a Rust programmer to help
- [poker](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/poker): An implementation of the Texas hold 'em poker rules and a Discord bot to play against others in chat
  - state: [released and public](https://top.gg/bot/46179194277933876)
  - still has much potential for new features
- [Genius Twitter Bot](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/genius-twitter-bot): Twitter bot that posts random lyrics from a given artist x times a day
  - due to changes in Genius web page layout, some new scraping bugs are occuring that need to be fixed
  - active here: [@bobooftheday](https://twitter.com/bobooftheday)
- [javadox](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/javadox): An HTML javadoc parser written in Kotlin
  - state: I hate HTML scraping
  - will it ever work correctly?
- [mela-command](https://github.com/mela-org/mela-command): An extensible general purpose Java command parsing framework with support for declarative and aspect-oriented programming
  - state: unreleased
  - needs more documentation (a lot more wiki pages as well as javadoc is planned)
  - support for multi-pattern matching on command methods planned
- Multiplayer Connect Four Game (not public yet)
  - state: complete, except for AI
  - school project
- A Discord bot connected to a webservice that lets Discord users file unban requests for servers they've been banned from (not public yet)
  - my first ever web-based project
  - everything already specified
  - simple frontend done
  - backend still needs the Discord side


### Ideas and approaches floating around

Stuff that I have thought about, only begun implementing or abandoned for some reason. I might pick those up again at some point, but they're not a priority without an incentive or help from someone else.

- A Notchian, fully asynchronous Minecraft server implementation written in Clojure
  - currently implementing the packet protocol (not public yet)
  - need to find a good TCP server library
  - more thought on the async nature and its implications needed
- [kartoffelskript](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/kartoffelskript): An esoteric programming language whose syntax only consists of correct German sentences
  - some unresolved issues with the current spec (e.g. function definition)
  - not entirely clear how to implement it
  - more research into the concepts of [plain English programming](https://osmosianplainenglishprogramming.blog/) could be useful as a directive
- [The Lick Bot](https://github.com/ashbash1987/lick_wikipedia_bot): Twitter bot that posts the infamous ["Lick"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q) with matching  lyrics taken from Wikipedia titles
  - although finished, the bot never went online - should do it myself some day
- [Telegram Schedule Bot](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/telegram-schedule-bot): A Telegram bot to notify me of schedule changes from my school
  - some critical, unfixed bugs left
  - kinda pointless now that I don't go to school anymore
- [DiscordMC](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/discordmc): A bridge between Discord and Spigot as a publicly available RESTful web service
- [guisl](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/guisl): Kotlin DSL for the Java dependency injection framework [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice)
- Own website 
  - opportunity to get more into webdev
  - could get to know jekyll and other static web page generators more
- [trackernetwork-java](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/trackernetwork-java): A collection of wrappers for the various APIs provided by [trackernetwork](https://tracker.gg)
- [sum-rewrite](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/sum-rewrite): A rewrite of the "Stifte und MÃ¤use"-libraries used for educational purposes in German computer science lessons

## Projects I've contributed to 

- [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities): Wrote a `TableBuilder` class to create string tables
- [discljord](https://github.com/IGJoshua/discljord): Wrote several utility namespaces and a [leiningen template](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/discljord-template)
- [learn-regex](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex): Revised and finished the German translation
- [AdventOfCode-2019](https://github.com/jkoenig134/AdventOfCode-2019): Wrote Clojure solutions for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges
- [DevcordBot](https://github.com/devcordde/DevcordBot): Wrote a command for the Discord bot of a German developer Discord server
