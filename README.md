### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a both a hobbyist and professional programmer with a particular interest in the JVM and its languages (Java, Kotlin, Clojure). I also feel comfortable with Python and have basic knowledge of C, Rust and frontend web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I have a general interest in functional programming and theoretical computer science.

In my spare time, I prefer writing libraries and tools for other programmers over applications with user interfaces. This reflects upon the majority of my open source projects.
